eformative website

The website is a fullstack site that uses the MERN stack. The database is a MongoDB serverless instance, the connect.txt file will go into an 
explanation of the database requirements for the site. The site utilizes the express api framework for the node.js backend that makes the site
CRUD capable. The frontend uses React framework, this site was created using CRA, so the production site is set up accordingly so, this is to 
avoid problems during production. Unfortunately CRA is no longer being maintained by Facebook and thus is on its way out. 
Whoever takes this site on will have to deal with certain problems that may arise from this. A conversion to a different potential framework
would be something to consider. The React developers say to convert to Next.Js which is very similar to React, both use state management 
and controlled components. Something else that needs to be addressed is the npm dependencies that the project uses, whoever takes on this codebase
will need to update these packages, there is the potential to have these updates create breaking changes in the site, so plan and test accordingly.

The site has a separate server directory that controls the backend of the app, as well as the backend dependencies that will also need updating, 
like the frontend there is potential to cause breaking changes. The Client directory will need updating as well. The site has styled components
with certain global styles applied to the page, the images have been compressed to take up less space. the site is hosted on GitHub Pages and
Heroku for the backend.
